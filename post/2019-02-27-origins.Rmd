It's hot today.

It's 36 degrees celcius, and in the southern-Australian summer,
outdoors feels like the moment when you open the oven,
and a burst of hot, dry air rushes towards your face. 
Only the heat doesn't go away, instead of the smell of food is replaced by the
smell of bushfires.

The high UV index also means staying indoor is the most sensible
thing to do.

So here I am, writing my first post on this blog.

-------------------------------------------------

#### Data Science

I'm a data scientist, working in the public sector.

It's an interesting space at the moment, 
as my department is not very mature in data science.

So I'll write a bit about the projects that I'm working on, 
and some of the real-life problems that I face in pushing for the use of
machine learning to solve existing problems (*if it aint broke, don't fix it*),
and new ones.

I'll also write about some interesting topics from time to time.

#### Photography

A few years ago, my twin brother moved to Hong Kong.

We used to do lots of things together; 
we played badminton together since around 10;
went to school together; went to the same university, etc.

Our geographic distance meant that we no longer had activities that we could do
together.

Until he picked up a camera.

Since then, we've become photography geeks, 
and it's a way for us to share our experiences, and our eyes), 
with each other.

I'm still horrible at photography, 
and my partner believes she has more talent than I, 
but I'll try and incorporate some of it into this blog.

--------------------------------------------------

#### Travel

I'm a millenial.

And the definition of a millenial is someone who travels 
(it's not in the dictionary, but Instagram would argue otherwise).

Hopefully, travelling will provide some inspiration to write about data science,
and opportunities to take more photos. 

I might even write about travels on this blog.

---------------------------------------------------

So this is it.

It's still hot.

And this is the end of the origin of my blog.
