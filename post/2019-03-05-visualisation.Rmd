```

When I was young, I didn't give a shi* about presentation.

I recall a school project, where the evaluation matrix specifically said
presentation would make up 50% of the score. 

I think I only presented numbers and text. 

And gave up 50% of the score.

Fast forward 20 years, and I'm now wiser to a truth that I had no inkling of
as a child: humans are visual animals.

As my blog is about data science, 
I think it's fitting to start one of the earlier posts about visualisation,
because future posts are going to rely on this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As many data people will relate to, I work in an environment where most
data visualisations are still created using Microsoft Excel or PowerPoint.

They're functional. They get the job done. But they lack life.

When all charts start to look the same, insights start to blur.

I don't promote a completely different look to each visualisation; 
that would be too chaotic.
But I think analyst should develop their own style.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had to pick a data set, and my friends and I have been talking about retirement. 
So I've picked a data set relating to this topic: Life Expectancy.

R is my go to, so any code you see below can be followed in RStudio.

Below, I'll go through how I create various types of charts:

* Bar chart
* Line chart
* 

#### Libraries

```{r}
library(WDI)     # World bank data API
library(dplyr)   # data manipulation
library(tidyr)   # data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # visualisation
```


#### Download data from World Bank

The data used is available from the (World Bank)[https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?view=map.

The R package *WDI* helps to search and download data from the World Bank by
providing the World Bank's *indicator* for the data set.

We can do a search as follows:

```{r}
WDIsearch(string = "life expectancy at birth")
```

Let's get both *male* and *female* data by using the following codes:

1. SP.DYN.LE00.MA.IN
2. SP.DYN.LE00.FE.IN

```{r}
male   <- WDI(country = "all", indicator = "SP.DYN.LE00.MA.IN", start = 1960, end = 2016)
female <- WDI(country = "all", indicator = "SP.DYN.LE00.FE.IN", start = 1960, end = 2016)

## Add gender column
male$gender   <- "Male"
female$gender <- "Female"

## Change column name
names(male)[3]   <- "life.expectancy"
names(female)[3] <- "life.expectancy"

## Combine data together
data <- rbind(male, female)
```


#### 1. Bar Chart

The humble bar chart.

Using the default ggplot aesthetic, it's clear that it's not publish-worthy.

```{r bar_chart, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
data %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(avg.life.expectancy = mean(life.expectancy, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = avg.life.expectancy)) +
  geom_col()
```

Some of the things that I would change are:

* Remove grey background
* Change y-axis to stop at 70
* Change y-axis titles
* Remove x-axis title, because gender is obvious
* Add title and subtitle
* Add some colour, to represent LIFE

The end result is the chart below.

It doesn't need to be complex. 
It just needs to delivery one message: 
Women have a higher life expectancy than men

```{r bar_chart_finessed, echo = T, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
data %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(avg.life.expectancy = mean(life.expectancy, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = avg.life.expectancy, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#88BA7B", "#88BA7B")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0),
                                    hjust = 0.96),
        axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "grey50"),
        axis.ticks.y = element_line()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 90, by = 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 70)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Age",
       title = "Life Expectancy",
       subtitle = "Worldwide")
```

#### 2. Line chart

Line charts should be used to represent time-series data.

Again, we start with a standard out-of-the-box ggplot.

```{r line_chart, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = data[data$country == "Hong Kong SAR, China", ],
       aes(x = year, y = life.expectancy, colour = gender)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Age",
       title = "Life Expectancy",
       subtitle = "Hong Kong SAR, China")

```

The reason the y-axis doesn't need to start at 0 is because there are no longer
cues to show how much more a data point is than another,
as is the case in a bar chart.


```{r line_chart_finessed, echo = T, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = data[data$country == "Hong Kong SAR, China", ],
       aes(x = year, y = life.expectancy, colour = gender)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#F18C8E", "#568EA6")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = "dotted", colour = "grey80"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0),
                                    hjust = 0.96),
        axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "grey50"),
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
        legend.position = c(0.9, 0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 5), 
                     limits = c(60, 90)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1960, 2020, by = 10)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "Age",
       title = "Life Expectancy",
       subtitle = "Hong Kong SAR, China")
  
```

#### Scatter plots

```{r scatter_plot, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
data %>%
  filter(year == 2016) %>%
  select(-iso2c) %>%
  spread(gender, life.expectancy) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Male, y = Female)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Gender gap in Life Expectancy")
  
```

```{r scatter_plot_finessed, echo = T, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
## Extract Australia
aus <- data %>%
  filter(year == 2016,
         country == "Australia") %>%
  select(-iso2c) %>%
  spread(gender, life.expectancy)

## Extract Hong Kong
hk <- data %>%
  filter(year == 2016,
         country == "Hong Kong SAR, China") %>%
  select(-iso2c) %>%
  spread(gender, life.expectancy)

size <- 3
shape <- 21

data %>%
  filter(year == 2016) %>%
  select(-iso2c) %>%
  spread(gender, life.expectancy) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Male, y = Female)) +
  geom_point(fill = "grey80", 
             colour = "grey80",
             size = size,
             shape = shape,
             alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_abline(colour = "grey70", linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  geom_point(data = aus, 
             aes(x = Male, y = Female),
             fill = "#F58426", 
             colour = "#F58426",
             shape = shape,
             size = size) +
  annotate(geom = "text", label = "Australia", x = 85, y = 82, 
           size = 3.5, colour = "#F58426") +
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = 83, y = 82, xend = 81, yend = 84, 
           size = 0.5, colour = "#F58426") +
  geom_point(data = hk, 
             aes(x = Male, y = Female),
             fill = "#007F91", 
             colour = "#007F91",
             shape = shape,
             size = size) +
  annotate(geom = "text", label = "Hong Kong", x = 77, y = 89, 
           size = 3.5, colour = "#007F91") +
    annotate(geom = "segment", x = 79.5, y = 88.5, xend = 80.5, yend = 87.5, 
           size = 0.5, colour = "#007F91") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line()) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 90)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(50, 90)) +
  labs(title = "Gender gap in Life Expectancy",
       subtitle = "Australia and Hong Kong",
       x = "", y = "") +    # replace axis labels  with annotations inside the chart
  annotate(geom = "text",
           label = "Male", 
           fontface = 2,
           x = 80, y = 50, colour = "grey50") +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           label = "life expectancy", 
           x = 85, y = 50, colour = "grey50") +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           label = "Female", 
           fontface = 2,
           x = 50, y = 75, colour = "grey50",
           angle = 90) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           label = "life expectancy", 
           x = 50, y = 84, colour = "grey50",
           angle = 90)
  
```


#### Colours

Colours contribute a lot to the look and feel of a visualisation.
When plots use standard colours, it's easy to tell how much effort has been put
into producing a data viz.

I also have weakness in differentiating reds and greens (red-green colour
blindness affects up to 8% of males), and so I avoid using colour palettes
that contain these colours.

I like to go to [Adobe Colors](https://color.adobe.com/explore/?filter=most-popular&time=month) to search for a colour palette to use.
