      <description>When I was young, I didn’t give a shi* about presentation.
I recall a school project, where the evaluation matrix specifically saidpresentation would make up 50% of the score.
I think I only presented numbers and text.
And gave up 50% of the score.
Fast forward 20 years, and I’m now wiser to a truth that I had no inkling ofas a child: humans are visual animals.</description>

      <description>It’s hot today.
It’s 36 degrees celcius, and in the southern-Australian summer, outdoors feels like the moment when you open the oven, and a burst of hot, dry air rushes towards your face. Only the heat doesn’t go away, instead of the smell of food is replaced by the smell of bushfires.
The high UV index also means staying indoor is the most sensible thing to do.
So here I am, writing my first post on this blog.</description>
